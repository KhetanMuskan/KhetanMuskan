I have worked independently on 'Quantified Multimodality MR Imaging Biomarkers for Diagnosis of cognitive impairment in elderly patients'. The project involves the application of discriminative classification model to classify mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and alzheimer's disease (AD) patients by using grey matter volume and network characteristics as independent variables.
